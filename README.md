# Word Cloud

A small one-off project demonstrating some JavaScript concepts for others. The intent is for a interactive word cloud to be formed from a bespoke JSON format.

### Core project focuses
 - Well architectured software
 - Strong unit testing
 - Strong e2e testing
 - UX and user driven
 - Sensible management through an agile methodology.

### How to run
Assumption of current nodeJS installation on system.

`npm start`

This should install any items necessary, including Bower defined dependencies, then run by default on `localhost:8000/app/index.html`. This can be changed by modifying the top level package.json file.
